# Idea
1. What if you could know where earthquakes are happening in the whole world?
2. What if you could know all the places on the earth where a pandemic is breaking out?

# Data Source
GDELT, backed by Google Jigsaw, is creating a platform to fundamentally reimagine how we study the human world in realtime at a planetary scale. In essence, GDELT monitors the news all over the world, traslates it, processes it to identify all events, counts, quotes, people, organizations, locations, themes, emotions, relevant imagery, video, and embedded social media posts, placed it into global context, and makes it available for enabling open research on the planet itself. 

Data refreshed every 15 minutes.
